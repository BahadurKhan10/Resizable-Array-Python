Resizeable array: 
Resizeable array is list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. It is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages. Dynamic arrays overcome a limit of static arrays, which have a fixed capacity that needs to be specified at allocation.

Resize logic: 
* When we insert = It will make new array of +1 size from current array and add our input to it (according  to condition eg at end, at first etc)

* When we delete = It will make new array of -1 size from current array and delete our input from it  (according to condition eg at end, at first etc)

* At last we will rename that new array to our original array and print it.
